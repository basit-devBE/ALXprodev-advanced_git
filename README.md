# Git Workflow

## Introduction
Git is a distributed version control system that helps developers collaborate on projects efficiently. Understanding the Git workflow is essential for managing changes and maintaining a clean project history.

## Basic Git Workflow

1. **Clone the Repository**
    ```sh
    git clone <repository_url>
    ```
    This command creates a local copy of the repository.

2. **Create a Branch**
    ```sh
    git checkout -b <branch_name>
    ```
    Create a new branch to work on a specific feature or bugfix.

3. **Make Changes**
    Edit the files in your working directory as needed.

4. **Stage Changes**
    ```sh
    git add <file_name>
    ```
    Stage the changes you want to include in the next commit.

5. **Commit Changes**
    ```sh
    git commit -m "Describe your changes"
    ```
    Commit the staged changes with a descriptive message.

6. **Push Changes**
    ```sh
    git push origin <branch_name>
    ```
    Push your changes to the remote repository.

7. **Create a Pull Request**
    Open a pull request on the repository's hosting service (e.g., GitHub, GitLab) to merge your changes into the main branch.

## Conclusion
Following a structured Git workflow ensures that your project remains organized and that team collaboration is smooth. Always remember to commit frequently with meaningful messages and to keep your branches up to date with the main branch.
